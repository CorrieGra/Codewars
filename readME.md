# Kata rankings
> If you are not familiar with Codewar's Kata challenges, they are ranked in kyu's from 8 - 1 increasing in difficulty the from easy at 8 kyu to most difficult at 1 kyu.

## Why am I doing these ?
> I spend 1 hour every day focusing on problem sovling by completing as many katas as possilbe. I do change between kyu's trying to improve my skills and the way I approach a more difficult situation.

## Folder Structure 
- Codewars
  - Kyu 7
  - Kyu 8

* Please note that I will add the lower lever kyu at the top when completing my first kata in that difficulty
``` 
ex: 
after completing my first kata of kyu 6 the folder structure will be
- Codewars
  - Kyu 6
  - Kyu 7
  - Kyu 8
  ```
